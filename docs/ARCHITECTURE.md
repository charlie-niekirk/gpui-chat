# Architecture

Seeded from the Architecture section of [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md). This document is
the living version: update it in the PR that changes the design. `PLAN.md` stays
the roadmap.

`gpui-chat` is a native Twitch chat client (in the spirit of Chatterino) written
in Rust on GPUI, consumed through GPUI Kit (`gpui-kit`, exact-pinned).

## Workspace

```
crates/
  app/         bin `gpui-chat` — the only crate that depends on GPUI. Views, actions, keymap, theme, platform/
  core/        domain types, message store, tokenizer. No I/O
  twitch/      IRC transport, Helix client, auth (device flow), later EventSub
  emotes/      providers: Twitch, BTTV, FFZ, 7TV; emote sets; resolution order; live updates
  media/       image fetch, disk cache, decode (static + animated), memory budget
  settings/    typed settings, load/save/watch, paths
  streamlink/  locate binary, launch, track child processes
assets/        fonts, icons, bundled themes, bundled global-badge snapshot   (added by later PRs)
fixtures/      recorded raw IRC lines, API JSON samples                      (added by later PRs)
docs/          ARCHITECTURE.md, BACKLOG.md
```

Package names are `gpui-chat-<dir>` for libraries (`gpui-chat-core`, …); the
binary package is `gpui-chat`. Crates other than `app` have no GPUI dependency:
they are unit-testable on any OS and let PR sessions work in parallel without
touching the same files.

Dependency direction: `app` → everything; `twitch`, `emotes`, `media`,
`settings`, `streamlink` → `core` at most; `core` depends on nothing but `std`
(plus pure-data crates such as `serde`). No cycles.

Third-party versions are pinned once in the root `Cargo.toml`
(`[workspace.dependencies]`); a crate opts in with `dep = { workspace = true }`
only when it actually uses the dependency.

### Application identity

`APP_NAME` and `APP_ID` live in `crates/core/src/lib.rs`. Everything that shows
the name or derives an identifier (window title, config dir, keychain service,
bundle ID, `User-Agent`) reads them from there, so a rename is one small PR.

### App shell (`crates/app`)

- `shell.rs` — root view: Kit `TitleBar`, collapsible Kit `Sidebar`, main area. Handles the
  window actions (`ToggleSidebar`, `CloseWindow`, `MinimizeWindow`, `About`); `Quit` is global.
- `theme.rs` — our own `Tokens` (dark/light), chosen from the system appearance (live, via
  `observe_window_appearance`) and mirrored into Kit's `Theme` so Kit components match.
  Theme packs (PR 4.4) extend `Tokens`.
- `fonts.rs` / `assets.rs` — bundled JetBrains Mono TTFs (`assets/fonts/`, OFL in `OFL.txt`) are
  embedded, registered with the text system at startup and the family is resolved against the
  installed list (GPUI panics on unknown families, so there is no blind fallback).
- `actions.rs` + `platform/` — action definitions; key bindings and the native menu bar are
  per-platform and live only under `platform/`. The Kit `native_menu` is a popup context menu;
  the application menu bar uses GPUI `cx.set_menus`.
- `state.rs` — `state.toml` in `<config dir>/<APP_NAME>/` with the last window placement
  (validated against connected displays on restore). Separate from user settings.

### Domain model (`crates/core`)

Dependency-free (std only), no I/O, no clock. Modules: `ids` (`ChannelId` = lowercase login,
`MessageId`, `EmoteId`), `emote` (`Emote`, `EmoteProvider`, `ImageUrls` by scale, `BadgeId` /
`Badge`), `message` (`Message`, `Author`, `Fragment`, `MessageKind`, `MessageFlags`, `ReplyRef`),
`store` (`MessageStore`), `event` (`ChatEvent`, `RoomState`), `tokenizer`.

- **`MessageStore`** hands out a monotonically increasing *sequence number* per pushed message
  (never reused; `first_seq`/`next_seq`/`iter_since` let the UI see what is new or scrolled out) and a
  *generation* that bumps on every change, including deletes and resizes. Deleting replaces the stored
  `Arc<Message>` with a copy flagged `deleted`; the old `Arc` is untouched.
- **Tokenizer** (`Tokenizer::tokenize(text, twitch_ranges)`): Twitch emote ranges first (code-point
  indices, invalid or overlapping ranges dropped), then per whitespace-delimited word: `WordResolver`
  (third-party emotes, whole word) → cheermote → emoji split → mention / link on the pieces. Zero-width
  emotes stack onto a directly preceding emote. Plain words and whitespace are merged into `Text`
  runs, so fragments concatenate back to the message text.
- Emoji detection uses small built-in Unicode range tables (no data crate); the TLD allow-list for
  bare domains is likewise built in.

### Media pipeline (`crates/media`)

GPUI-free; takes a tokio `Handle` and the cache directory from the caller. `ImageCache<V>`
looks up memory LRU → in-flight load (joined, so N requests for a URL make one fetch) →
remembered failure → new load task: disk cache → network (`reqwest`/rustls, `User-Agent:
<APP_NAME>/<version>`, bounded concurrency, per-attempt timeout, exponential retry on
timeouts/network errors/408/429/5xx) → decode on the blocking pool (bounded) → disk write →
memory insert. 404/410 and undecodable images are remembered for 10 min, other failures 30 s.

- **Pixels:** every frame is **BGRA8, straight (non-premultiplied) alpha**, tightly packed,
  full canvas size — what `gpui-pre 0.3.12`'s `RenderImage` stores (its own decoders only swap
  R/B on `image`'s straight RGBA). `DecodedFrame::into_pixels` hands the buffer over without a
  copy for `image::RgbaImage::from_raw` → `image::Frame::from_parts` → `RenderImage::new`.
- **Decode:** PNG/APNG, GIF, WebP (still + animated, composited on a transparent canvas like
  browsers). Delays under 20 ms become 100 ms. `DecodeLimits` (default 2048 px per side,
  1024 frames, 64 MB decoded) reject oversized canvases and truncate long animations.
  Decode cost is benchmarked in `crates/media/benches/decode.rs`.
- **Memory:** `ByteLru` with a byte budget (default 256 MB). `V: CacheValue` lets the app store
  its own value (e.g. `Arc<RenderImage>` plus a `Timeline`) so pixels are held once.
  `on_evict` fires for every entry leaving memory (to release GPU textures), `on_ready` when a
  load finishes (to repaint); both run off the UI thread with no locks held.
- **Render path:** `get_if_ready(url)` (memory only, never blocks) or `get_or_request(url)`;
  `Timeline::frame_at(elapsed)` maps one global animation clock to a frame index and the time
  to the next frame change.
- **Disk:** `<dir>/v1/<aa>/<sha256(url)[..16] hex>`, each entry with a header holding the full
  URL and body length; written to a temp file and renamed; size cap (default 256 MB) with LRU
  eviction by mtime; truncated or corrupt entries are deleted and refetched.
- **Scale:** `scale::select(urls, display_scale, emote_scale)` takes the smallest variant with
  at least `display_scale × emote_scale` density, else the largest below;
  `logical_size` gives the draw size independent of the variant.

## Data flow

```
twitch-irc / Helix / emote APIs   (tokio threads)
        │  ChatEvent over a bounded channel
        ▼
ChannelStore (one GPUI entity per joined channel)   ← tokenizer + EmoteResolver
        │  drained at most once per frame, one notify per batch
        ▼
ChatView → list() → MessageElement (custom Element)  ← ImageCache
```

- **`core::Message`** is immutable behind `Arc`: id, timestamp, author (login,
  display name, colour, badges), `fragments`, kind (chat, action, notice,
  user-notice, system), flags (mention, first message, highlighted, deleted,
  history), optional reply reference.
- **`core::Fragment`**: `Text`, `Emote { emote, zero_width_overlays }`, `Emoji`,
  `Mention`, `Link`, `Cheer`.
- **`MessageStore`**: ring buffer per channel, default 1 000 messages (setting),
  O(1) push and evict.
- **Emote resolution:** Twitch emotes come from IRC tag ranges (ranges count
  Unicode code points, not bytes). Remaining words are looked up: channel 7TV →
  channel BTTV → channel FFZ → global 7TV → global BTTV → global FFZ. Zero-width
  emotes stack on the preceding emote.
- Async I/O runs on a `tokio` runtime on background threads. GPUI has its own
  executor; backends talk to the UI over channels.

## Rendering (the performance-critical part)

- **`MessageElement`** implements GPUI's `Element` directly. It shapes text runs
  with the window text system, flows fragments into lines itself, and paints
  emote and badge images at computed positions. One element per message — not
  one element per word.
- **Layout cache** per message keyed by (width, font generation, scale factor);
  invalidated on resize or settings change.
- **Virtualisation** with GPUI `list()` / `ListState` in bottom-follow mode.
  Scrolling up pauses following and shows a "new messages" pill.
- **Ingest batching:** events are drained once per frame; a burst of 1 000
  messages causes one layout pass, not 1 000.
- **Images:** fetched and decoded off the UI thread; de-duplicated in flight;
  disk cache keyed by URL hash; in-memory LRU with a byte budget (default
  256 MB); GPU textures released on eviction.
- **Animation:** one global clock so identical emotes stay in sync. Animation
  frames are requested only while an animated emote is visible and the window is
  active. Setting to disable animation.
- **Fallback** if the custom element is blocked by an API gap: wrap-flex of
  per-word elements to keep the phase moving, with a backlog item to return.

Chat rendering uses core GPUI primitives only, so GPUI Kit churn cannot break
it; Kit components (sidebar, dock, menus, dialogs, …) stay in `crates/app`.

## Performance budgets

Measured with the replay harness (PR 1.3); enforced in PR 6.1.

| Metric | Target on Apple Silicon |
|---|---|
| Frame time while scrolling, one pane at 100 msg/s | p99 under 8.3 ms |
| Burst ingest | 1 000 msg/s without input lag |
| Idle CPU, no animated emote visible | under 1 % |
| Memory, 10 channels × 1 000 messages, default image budget | under 300 MB |
| Launch to first window | under 300 ms |

## Cross-platform guardrails

Platform-specific code lives only in `crates/app/src/platform/`. Paths, keychain
and process spawning go through `dirs`, `keyring` and the `streamlink` crate. CI
runs non-GPUI crate tests on Ubuntu from PR 0.1 (job `linux`).

## Technology choices

| Area | Choice | Note |
|---|---|---|
| UI | `gpui-kit = "=0.9.1"` (exact pin) | Kit usage stays inside `crates/app`. Version bumps are their own PRs |
| Async I/O | `tokio` | Background threads; channels to the UI |
| Chat read | `twitch-irc` over TLS (rustls) | Anonymous by default; same parser handles history lines |
| Helix + auth | `twitch_api` (helix) + `twitch_oauth2` device flow | Send, badges, emotes, streams, moderation |
| HTTP | `reqwest` (rustls) | `User-Agent: gpui-chat/<version>` |
| Images | `image` crate, WebP preferred, GIF/PNG fallback | Avoid AVIF (native decoder dependency) |
| Secrets | `keyring` | macOS Keychain now; Secret Service / Credential Manager later |
| Config | TOML via `serde` + `toml`, `notify` for hot reload | `~/.config/gpui-chat/{settings,keymap}.toml`, `themes/*.toml` |
| Paths | `dirs` | Cache in the platform cache dir |
| Font | Bundled upstream JetBrains Mono (OFL-1.1) | Default chain: `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` → bundled `JetBrains Mono` → system monospace |
